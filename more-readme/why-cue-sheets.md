There's nothing wrong with using a phone to navigate on your bicycle.
Especially if you are a roady trying to go for your best time on an
established route. And as is always the case with bicycles: do whatever
it takes to get riding. If letting your phone tell you where to go makes
it easier for you to get out there, go for it. But that's not the kind
of riding I do (mostly). I like to pick some remote spot, find a route
out there that gets off the beaten path, and then (preferably) a loop
back home on a different route.

When I say "remote" and "off the beaten path" I don't mean a
back-country fire trail that goes two miles out beyond the last ice
cream stand (though sometimes I do). Remote can also mean a neighborhood
I haven't been to, a beach I've never visited, or (as is often the case
in NJ) some small town in a different state. On a bicycle, the way there
often takes me through industrial zones where trucks load municipal
waster and huge pieces of metal get welded together. Sometimes along
rarely-used bike paths that are lumpy with long neglect and peppered
with broken glass, and those sometimes cut across highway on-ramps or I
have to hump my bike over guard rails. The routes seem to always wind
through the interminable tracts of row houses in the outer boroughs of
NYC. It often ends up being pretty adventurous, without ever leaving
the city. (And often not really suited to road-bikes, or any kind of
bike that you are particularly precious about. You want a bike that
can take a bit of a beating, but is comfortable for long hours in the
saddle because riding block-by-block through a dense city can be slow.)

The point is, I like to go far out to places I haven't been before.
Doing this adds to the mental map I have in my head. I've been doing
this for more than a decade in NYC, and the process I have has given me
a surface map of NYC roads that rivals only old cab drivers these days.
(Since young cab drivers, like everyone else, just use their phones.)

The pleasure in this comes not just from the ability to tell someone
how to get there without resorting to a phone though. There's a kind of
satisfaction that comes with a route that works out. Every time the cue
sheet is right, and the turn shows up where it's supposed to, and that
little section of detail gets plugged into the growing map in my head,
I get that same feeling you get when you find a piece that fits in a
puzzle and snap it in. Humans are *really* good at spatial memory, so
adding to your mental map (at least for most people) feels like it takes
barely any effort at all. Given that, it's pretty odd how much people
now just lazily go to their phones for navigation.

Of course the opposite is also true: it's incredibly frustrating to
get lost. But it's hard to get TOO lost these days, and if you do, you
can always pull out your phone. Or if you are like me and refuse to
bring a phone I like to have a paper map as a backup if I'm really going
out for a serious ride. In a worst-case scenario you can always ask
someone how to get back onto your cue sheet. (Generally, I like to avoid
this though -- not because I'm a dude, but because I feel it undermines
your mental-map making. You don't want to just get un-lost, you want to
*understand* where you are.)

## Why not just print directions from Google?

I do need directions. But I need them to be manageable (ideally) without
stopping, flipping pages, trying to read tiny print with unnecessary
verbiage, etc. I want directions that are simple, quickly understood
while moving, have *just* enough detail, and most importantly: jibe
with the mental map in my head. The map in my head is what I'm really
steering by. The cues are just reminders.

Google maps (and, I'm pretty sure, virtually all other automatic
route-generating software) creates routes with FAR too much detail. So
while Google's route is a good place to start, I want simpler routes.
To get this, I adjust the routes by hand. There are also often places
where Google's algorithm wants you to ride (or not ride) but I know a
better route. The perennial example of this is where you can salmon the
wrong way one block up a one-way street and avoid a long and potentially
more dangerous way around that Google want you to go. Also, in NYC there
are many bridges, paths, connectors, stairs and whatnot Google tries to
avoid but are easier to just take.

In the end it can almost be worth skipping Google's directions all
together and just writing your own cues by following the route on Google
maps closely and writing down how you see each step. Many of my cue
sheets are done this way, but it is admittedly laborious.
