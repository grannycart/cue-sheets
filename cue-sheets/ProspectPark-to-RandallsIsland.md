## Prospect Park to Randalls Island

- https://goo.gl/maps/ewpEoiA37s7VQEcb7  

This is how I start every ride to the South Bronx.

To get from (or to) Randall's Island, resist Google's efforts to avoid the Triborough (unless you are coming from Manhattan anyway). The Triborough (fuck the renaming) is a spectacularly frightening bridge to ride a bicycle over. There's a few stairs, and signs that you are supposed to walk your bike. Don't worrry about either. But take it easy over the main span -- the path there is about 2-bike-handlebar-widths wide and a guardrail at handlebar height,  200-foot drop to the river on one side and a 20-foot drop to the highway on the other. Take a moment to revel in the height and the view. Totally worth the terror.
