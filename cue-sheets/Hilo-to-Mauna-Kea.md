
## Hilo, Hawaii to Mauna Kea; 44.1 miles
- https://goo.gl/maps/29yF83u3gKFQbYj76

Years ago I remember reading about the controversy over observatories atop Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii. I have nothing to add to the arguments for or against telescopes vs sacred peaks, but I had the thought: if there's telescopes on top of that volcano, there must be a road up there. Sure enough, you can ride your bike from sea level in Hilo, Hawaii, more than 13,000 feet up the side of the volcano to the peak in under 45 miles.

I've never done this. But it's hard to imagine a more perfect (or brutal) climb. One could dip your wheel in the Pacific Ocean in Hilo, and be at the top of the highest mountain on the planet (counting from the base on the ocean floor) in ten turns (most jut to get out of town) and a mere 9 hours of riding. If you drive up, you have to stop to acclimatize to the altitude, but apparently riding up goes so slow stopping isn't necessary. And coming back down: 3 hours at presumably brake-melting speeds.

Someday I will put a bike together *just* to do this climb, and ride the thing. One stupid low gear.
