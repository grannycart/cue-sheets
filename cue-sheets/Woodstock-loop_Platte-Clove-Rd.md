
## Woodstock Loop: Ashokan Reservoir With Platte Clove Road; 42 miles
- https://goo.gl/maps/drFaadyNabwSdQyF9

Legend has it that Platte Clove Road was included in the Tour de Trump back in the 80s to break pro road bikers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_DuPont). It's a long, tough, beautiful Catskill back-road climb, but I didn't find it that hard with a granny-geared touring bike. (Sorry Catskill boosters, that road is *not* harder than climbs in the mountains of France, and legends of pro riders cracking and walking up seem extremely dubious to me.) Just for fun I also threw Ohayo Mountain road into this ride, which is a short climb, and not actually that hard, but *looks* awesome with crazy switchbacks and views of the reservoir. You could choose to skip that climb and just start and finish out of Woodstock. If you reverse this loop and come DOWN Platte Clove Road, it's still a killer climb up the Kaaterskill Creek road. Despite the overblown infamy of Platte Clove Road, with 4000' feet of climbing in 40 miles, this isn't the ride for you if you are scared of the hills.
