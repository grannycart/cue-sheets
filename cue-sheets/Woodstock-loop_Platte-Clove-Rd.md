
## Woodstock Loop: Ashokan Reservoir With Platte Clove Road; 42 miles
- https://goo.gl/maps/Jcf6rVyGiowt61G78

Legend has it that Platte Clove Road was included in the Tour de Trump
back in the 80s to break pro road bikers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_DuPont). It's a long tough climb,
but I didn't find it that hard with a granny-geared touring bike. (Sorry Catskill boosters, that road is NOT harder than climbs in the mountains of France.) Just
for fun I also threw Ohayo Mountain road into this ride, which is
short and not actually that hard, but looks awesome with crazy
switchbacks and views of the reservoir. You could choose to skip that
climb and just start and finish out of Woodstock. If you reverse this
loop and come DOWN Platte Clove Road, it's still a killer climb up the
Kaaterskill Creek road.
