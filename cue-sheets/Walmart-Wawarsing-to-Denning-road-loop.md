https://goo.gl/maps/WJGUy9x61LJND1xs9

### Start: Wal-Mart Wawarsing, NY 12458

1. Head southwest on US-209 S toward Old Rte 209 .5 mi
4. => onto State Rte 55 W 3.4 mi
5. => onto NY-55A W 7.6 mi
6. => onto Sundown Rd .2 mi
7. <= onto Sugarloaf Rd 4.0 mi
	* (This is a nearly 5 mile climb. Not insanely steep, but unrelenting. Prepare yourself!)
8. Bear right/Continue onto Red Hill Rd (at Dinch Rd) 1.7 mi
9. <= onto New Rd Hill (at Red Hill Knolls Rd) .8 mi
	* Note: in 2023 the road sign was missing for this road. There was only a sign for "Red Hill Rd")
10. <= onto Denning Rd (at T) 2.3 mi
11. Slight left onto Red Hill Rd .7 mi
	* (This is critical, otherwise you are going way out of your way --- if you cross the river a second time on Denning Rd, you've gone too far)
12. => onto Barnes Rd .8 mi
	* (If you miss this, Red Hill Road will just take you back to Sugarloaf Rd, where you would take a right)
13. => onto Glade Hill Rd 2.2 mi
	* (If you miss this, Barnes takes you back to Red Hill Rd, where you would take a right and it would take to Sugarloaf.)
	* Turns onto Moore Hill Rd
14. <= onto Glade Hill Rd 1.9 mi
	* (Missing this will take you out of your way, but Moore Hill Rd will eventually dump you back on 55.)
15. => onto Sugarloaf Rd .4 mi
16. => onto Sundown Rd .2 mi
17. <= onto NY-55A E 7.6 mi
18. <= onto State Rte 55 E 3.1 mi
