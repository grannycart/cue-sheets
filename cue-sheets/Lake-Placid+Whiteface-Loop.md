
## Lake Placid Loop, with Whiteface climb; 54.7 miles
- https://goo.gl/maps/fXWW76EokjrusmrDA

A shockingly beautiful 50 mile loop through the Adirondacks, starting and ending at Lake Placid. As a bonus, take a left at North Pole to climb Whiteface which might me the only serious road bike climb in NY State. Or skip it and cut 2300' of climbing out of your ride. There's not many roads in the Adirondacks, so it's hard to get lost. And the roads there are tend to follow the valleys so the climbing is generally pretty modest, unless you choose detours like Whiteface. There's a giftshop at the top of Whiteface where you might be able to buy snacks.
