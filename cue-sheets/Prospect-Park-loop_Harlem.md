## Prospect Park Loop -- Through Harlem and across the Queensboro Bridge; 30 mi
* https://goo.gl/maps/R4cM2rsTSZZuBhdk6

This is really going to be just a fantastic loop ride, someday. The problem has always been, and continues to be, that East Side bike path. I don't think it has ever been entirely open. The closed sections are extremely frustrating because it is quite a long way around, and basically makes it not worth going down to that bike path at all. Of course the day they finally get it entirely open will likely be the day that a full circumnavigation of Manhattan by bicycle becomes an easy, fun ride instead of an aggravating display of poorly implemented city government resources.

Other than that, this is a pretty good 30 mile ride for NYC. Beware the West Side bike path -- it's extremely flat and very long. People think it's good for riding because it looks good on paper, but in reality it is entirely exposed to the wind. If you get the wind in your face it can become a brutal slog. There's an easy solution: just be sure to check the wind speed and direction before you leave, and then ride this loop in the direction that puts the wind at your back when you hit the West Side.

	* NOTE: As of Winter 2023, this section of the bike path is closed. You need to take Pleasant Ave into Thomas Jefferson Park and go over the ped bridge over FDR Dr to the East Side bike path.
	* And then the bike path is block again around 80th St. So you have to get off the bike path and take York Ave down 60th St.
